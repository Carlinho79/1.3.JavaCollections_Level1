# 1.3 – Java Collections – Level 1

---

## 📄 Description

This project is part of **Sprint 1 (Java)** in **IT Academy**.  
It focuses on learning how to use **Java Collections Framework**, such as `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and file manipulation, through three progressive exercises.

The main goal is to **get familiar with Java Collections** and understand how to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

## 🧠 Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1 – Months of the Year
Stores the twelve months in an `ArrayList` and displays them in order.  
It introduces the concept of Java lists and iteration.

**Key Class:** `Month.java`

---

### Exercise 2 – List Manager
Implements a `ListManager` class capable of adding, removing, and sorting elements.  
It demonstrates how to manipulate and organize data inside collections.

**Key Class:** `ListManager.java`

---

### Exercise 3 – Countries and Capitals Game
A small quiz game using a `HashMap<String, String>` to map countries to their capitals.  
The program:
1. Reads data from `countries.txt`.
2. Asks the user for their name.
3. Displays ten random countries.
4. Prompts for their capitals and scores correct answers.
5. Saves the final score to `scores.txt`.

**Key Classes:** `CountryGame.java`, `FileManager.java`

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/1.3-JavaCollections-Nivell1.git

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition).
3. Ensure each exercise directory (Exercise1, Exercise2, Exercise3) is marked as a Java source root.
4. Mark the Resources folder (in Exercise 3) as Resources Root.

---

## ▶️ Execution
Each exercise contains its own Main.java entry point:
* Exercise 1: Level1/Exercise1/App/Main.java
* Exercise 2: Level1/Exercise2/App/Main.java
* Exercise 3: Level1/Exercise3/App/Main.java
Run each file individually to test the corresponding program.
Example (Exercise 3):
  Enter your name: Beto
  What is the capital of France? → Paris
  ✅ Correct!
  ...
  Game over – Final Score: 8/10
  Your result has been saved in scores.txt.
